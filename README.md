# Project Title: ML_Audio_ID - Identifying Music in Audio Tracks Using Machine Learning

Use Machine Learning to positively identify if an audio clip includes music.

## Project Scope

This project will focus on using existing machine learning algorithms to develop a system that accurately determines whether a short audio track contains music. The solution aims to lay the foundation for a larger project involving the identification of musical pieces used in broadcast media, specifically on National Public Radio (NPR).

## Problem Statement

National Public Radio frequently uses interesting music to close out news and editorial segments. Unfortunately, they do not consistently publish the title or artist of these tracks, which leaves the listening community without an easy way to discover the music they find intriguing. Correctly identifying tracks that contain outro music is a crucial first step in a chain that ultimately allows listeners to discover the music featured in these segments. Given that API-based music identification services charge per job, it's important to avoid unnecessary processing of tracks that do not contain music. This project aims to build a system that ensures only relevant audio tracks (i.e., those containing music) are sent for further identification, thereby saving resources and reducing costs.

## Project Goals

- Develop a reliable system that accurately identifies audio tracks that contain music.
- Explore the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in solving this problem.
- Gain a deeper understanding of audio data processing and classification using machine learning.

## Tools and Resources

The project will utilize existing Python-based machine learning libraries to determine their effectiveness and applicability for this task. A training corpus of audio tracks, consisting of segments with and without music, is being compiled and will be used for training and evaluation.

## Project Timeline

The project duration is two weeks, broken down as follows:

- **Week 1**:
  - **Days 1-2**: Define the problem in greater detail and compile and label the training dataset.
  - **Days 3-5**: Explore existing ML algorithms and develop an initial prototype of the audio classification system.
- **Week 2**:
  - **Days 6-8**: Evaluate the performance of different algorithms, optimize the solution, and finalize the model.
  - **Days 9-10**: Prepare the final report and documentation, and compile the codebase for submission.

## Deliverables

- A short report detailing the machine learning algorithms explored, the evaluation of their effectiveness for the task, and a summary of findings.
- A Git repository containing the project code, including Jupyter Notebooks, scripts, and supporting Markdown documents to explain the workflow, methodologies used, and the results obtained.

## Significance
This project supports personal growth by enhancing skills related to AI, data science, and self-directed research. It offers hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms and showcases the development of a solution with direct connection to the program.
